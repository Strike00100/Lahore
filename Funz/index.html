    <li><strong>💊 Medical Supplies:</strong> Purchase life-saving medicines, diagnostic kits, and preventive care materials for thousands of patients.</li>
    <li><strong>👩‍⚕️ Staff Salaries:</strong> Pay qualified doctors and nurses to provide respectful and professional care at just $1 to $1.5 per visit.</li>
